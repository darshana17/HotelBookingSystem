1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:01,180
.

2
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:02,120
All right!

3
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,120
Great!

4
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:08,990
One thing you'll notice when studying programming languages is that the concepts you encounter are interrelated.

5
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:14,600
This means focusing on a single topic can hardly deliver the content that must be explained in its entirety.

6
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:18,300
To this story, SQL makes no exception.

7
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:22,150
Despite that, we must start from somewhere, right?

8
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:26,960
My working experience tells me you will be much faster in learning and writing efficient queries if

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,900
you go through a brief introduction to databases.

10
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,640
It is the best thing to begin with,

11
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,320
so here's what I would like to share with you.

12
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:40,430
The table you see here contains data about the customer cells of a furniture store. And, this is how we

13
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,140
should read this information:

14
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:46,840
Purchase number one was registered on the 3rd of September 2016.

15
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:54,490
Then customer number one bought the item with code A1. Each of the four elements has a specific meaning.

16
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,620
We will call each one a data value.

17
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:04,200
All four data values make up one record. A record is each entry that exists in a table.

18
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,810
It corresponds to a row of the table.

19
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:13,330
Therefore, these four data values form one record, and these data values regarding purchase number two

20
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:15,060
form another record.

21
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,730
You could use the terms row and record interchangeably.

22
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:23,540
Besides the rows, you can see the data is separated into four columns or fields.

23
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:29,430
A field is a column in a table containing specific information about every record in the table.

24
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:35,770
This means all the records in a table, regardless if they are 10, 10000, or 10 million, will have a certain

25
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:38,210
purchase, number date of purchase,

26
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:44,390
customer ID, and item information.
When the data you have is organized in rows and columns,

27
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:50,060
this means you are dealing with stored tabular data. That is important to mention because you will often

28
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:56,680
see in the literature that database management relates to data stored in tabular form. Great!

29
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,870
Here comes the more interesting part. In this table,

30
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:03,040
we know nothing about a customer besides her ID.

31
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,720
The information about customers is stored in another table, called 'Customers'.

32
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:13,150
There are several fields, such as first and last names, email address, and the number of times customers

33
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,670
have filed a complaint in our store.

34
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:18,370
So, what would the logic of that structure be?

35
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:24,360
Every time we have a customer with an ID number one in the 'Sales' table, we can refer to the customer

36
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:32,180
with ID number one in the 'Customers' table and see her name, email, and number of complaints filed.

37
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:34,310
Same goes for the 'Items' table.

38
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:41,120
It contains the item code, product description, it's unit price ID, and name of the company that has delivered

39
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,750
it, and the company's headquarters phone number. Here,

40
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:50,840
the connection between the 'Sales' table and the 'Items' table is not the 'customer ID', but the 'item code'.

41
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:57,340
Well, we could stuff this information into one table and it would look like this.

42
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:58,920
Ouch!

43
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,320
It is huge!

44
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:05,420
I would not want to imagine what the table would look like if we had registered over 10 rows!

45
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:11,270
My point is - there are too many columns, and it is hard to understand what type of information is contained

46
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,040
in the larger table.

47
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,710
Relational algebra allows us to use mathematical logic and create a relation between a few tables in

48
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:21,710
a way that allows us to retrieve data efficiently.

49
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:28,610
Namely, these three tables - 'Sales', 'Customers', and 'Items' - are related through the customer ID or the 'item

50
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:35,510
code' columns and form a relational database. And, importantly, each one bears a specific meaning and contains

51
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,260
data characterizing it.

52
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:43,130
One of the tables contains information about sales, the other about customers, and the third about the

53
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,530
items.

54
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,500
To recap,

55
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:51,390
remember the data values in a row form a record in a table, and each column represents a field that carries

56
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:54,030
specific information about every record.

57
00:03:54,920 --> 00:04:01,760
A few related tables form a relational database. And, for those of you who are interested in slightly

58
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:07,610
more technical definitions, remember the smallest unit that can contain a meaningful set of data is called

59
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:09,230
an entity.

60
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:12,960
Therefore, the rows represent the horizontal entity in the table,

61
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,560
the columns - its vertical entity.

62
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,140
The table is a bigger data entity on its own.

63
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:24,940
It can also be referred to as a database object. A single row of a table, being a single occurrence of

64
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:34,160
that entity, can be also called an entity instance. O. Great! We will gradually build the theoretical preparation

65
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,410
you need before you begin coding.

66
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:42,680
Stay tuned for the next lecture, where you'll see SQL's role when working with relational databases.

67
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,490
Thanks for watching!
